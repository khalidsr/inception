# Inception
This project seeks to enhance understanding in the field of system administration.
The tutorial will guide you through the process of virtualizing multiple Docker images, constructing them within your newly established personal virtual machine.
# What is Container
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
# What is Docker
Docker container technology was launched in 2013 as an open source Docker Engine.
It leveraged existing computing concepts around containers and specifically in the Linux world, primitives known as cgroups and namespaces.
Docker’s technology is unique because it focuses on the requirements of developers and systems operators to separate application dependencies from infrastructure.
# Virtual Machines
Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine.
Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries – taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot.

# Comparing Containers and Virtual Machines
Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware.
Containers are more portable and efficient.
